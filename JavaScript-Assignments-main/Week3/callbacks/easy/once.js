// Problem Description – once(fn)

// You are required to implement a wrapper function named once that accepts an asynchronous function fn.
// The wrapper should ensure that fn is executed only on the first call.
// Any subsequent calls must not re-execute fn and should instead return the same Promise or resolved result from the first invocation.

   let isRuning;
   return function () {
    if (!isRuning) {
      isRuning = fn()
    }
    return isRuning
   }

  console.log("Running expensive operation!");
  return "result";
